### SportsStore project

Folder structure:
- **Models** - This folder will contain the data model and the classes that provide access to the data in
the application’s database.
- **Controllers** - This folder will contain the controller classes that handle HTTP requests.
- **Views** - This folder will contain all the Razor files, grouped into separate subfolders.
- **Views/Home** - This folder will contain Razor files that are specific to the Home controller, which I create
in the “Creating the Controller and View” section.
- **Views/Shared** - This folder will contain Razor files that are common to all controllers.
