    /*  The `Checkout` action method is decorated with the HttpPost attribute, which means that it will be used
    to handle POST requestsâ€”in this case, when the user submits the form.
        When a request is processed, the model binding system tries to find values for the properties defined by the Order
    class. This works on a best-effort basis, which means I may receive an Order object lacking property values if
    there is no corresponding data item in the request.
        To ensure I have the data I require, I applied validation attributes to the Order class. ASP.NET Core checks the 
    validation constraints that I applied to the Order class and provides details of the result through the ModelState property. 
    I can see whether there are any problems by checking the ModelState.IsValid property. 
        I call the `ModelState.AddModelError` method to register an error message if there are no items in the cart.
