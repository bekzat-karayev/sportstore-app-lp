        calls the Database.Migrate method if there are any pending migrations, which means that the database will be created 
        and prepared so that it can store Product objects. Next, the number of Product objects in the database is checked. 
        If there are no objects in the database, then the database is populated using a collection of Product objects 
        using the AddRange method and then written to the database using the SaveChanges method.
