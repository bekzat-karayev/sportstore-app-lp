@*  Blazor relies on a Razor Page to provide the initial content to the browser, which includes the JavaScript code
that connects to the server and renders the Blazor HTML content. Therefore, Index.cshtml is created.

        are the confusingly named Blazor building blocks, and the component element applied in here is named Routed.
            The Razor Page also contains a script element that tells the browser to load the JavaScript file that 
        Blazor Server uses. Requests for this file are intercepted by the Blazor Server middleware, and you donâ€™t need 
        to explicitly add the JavaScript file to the project. -->
