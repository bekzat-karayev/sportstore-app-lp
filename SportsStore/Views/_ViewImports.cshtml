@*  The @using statement in Razor pages works the same as plain using statement in CSharp files. *@

@*  Tag Helpers are a feature in ASP.NET Core that enables server-side code to participate in the creation 
and rendering of HTML elements in Razor files. 
    Most ASP.NET Core components, such as controllers and views, are discovered automatically, but tag
helpers have to be registered.
    The * wildcard specifies that all Tag Helpers within the specified assembly 
(Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers in this case) should be made available for use in the Razor view.*@
